##Service Design of whole services

Service designers design a service as a whole to achieve a policy intent meeting user needs. Serv ice designers work closely with User Researchers, Interaction Designers, Content Designers within UCD, and with Service Owners, Governance, Policy, as well as Data, Technology, Procurement or 3rd Party management to understand, map, shape, and design a service as a whole from a user-centred point of view.

These are the kinds of activities a Service Designer will do at each GDS delivery stage.
